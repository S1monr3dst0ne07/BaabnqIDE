the debug protocol is a way for the virtual machine and the ide to talk

data output protocol:
    the virtual machine will send all sorts of data to the ide, always formated like this:
    category(data)
    
    category are a way for the virtual machine to categorize the data that it sends, if that wasn't clear yet.
    the categories include:
    Print - stdio, aka inp and out (for inp the ide send back normal data)
    Chr   - sending a single character via putstr (renamed putchr, in ascii)
    HeapUsage - how much of the heap is used: current:max
    Var - Variables (dict)
    Plugin  - call to pluging
    Stack - change to stack: push:<num> or pull:0
    Mode - update mode: Running, Breakpoint
    
breakpoint: 
    a breakpoint is trigger when the virtual machine hits the 'breakpoint 0' instruction
    after the breakpoint is triggered the machine will wait for an instruction by opening a prompt with a question mark
    the commands that can be given to the virtual machine include:
    Continue - stop the breakpoint handling and continue normal running
    Next - just execute the next instruction and wait for more instructions
